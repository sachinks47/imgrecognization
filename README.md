# Image Recognition with KNN and PCA

This project performs **image classification** using a simple machine learning pipeline:

- 📷 Image Preprocessing  
- 📉 Dimensionality Reduction with **PCA**  
- 🎯 Classification with **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

It also includes dataset splitting, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation — with specific guidance for running in **Google Colab** using **Google Drive**.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Reduces the dimensionality of image features.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Classifies images based on feature similarity in reduced space.

> If only a `Train/` folder exists, the code allows you to automatically split it into a `Test/` folder.

---

## 🚀 How to Run (Google Colab Setup)

### 1. Mount Google Drive

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

### 2. Update the paths according to your Drive:

train_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/IMG/Train'
   , test_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/IMG/Test'

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

numpy, pandas: Data manipulation
PIL: Image processing
sklearn: ML models, PCA, scaling, evaluation
matplotlib, seaborn: (Optional) Visualization
os, shutil: File management

## 📌 Notes

Ensure consistent folder structure between Train/Test datasets.
You can change image resolution (size=(64, 64)) or PCA components (n_components=50) to suit your use case.
Accuracy will vary depending on image quality and data balance.
