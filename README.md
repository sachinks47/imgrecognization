# Image Recognition with KNN and PCA

This project performs **image classification** using a simple machine learning pipeline:

- 📷 Image Preprocessing  
- 📉 Dimensionality Reduction with **PCA**  
- 🎯 Classification with **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Reduces the dimensionality of image features.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Classifies images based on feature similarity in reduced space.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

numpy, pandas: Data manipulation
PIL: Image processing
sklearn: ML models, PCA, scaling, evaluation
matplotlib, seaborn: (Optional) Visualization
os, shutil: File management
